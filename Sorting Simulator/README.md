Bubble sort.

This all visualization will be done on Bars(Mostly used in graphs).

First of all bars will be generated randomly and then those will be sorted based on algoritm selected.

open command prompt (type cmd in search and click open as administrator and then click yes)

then change current directory to the folder that contains project.

then type "npm install" and make sure you have installed npm

then there will be a folder generated named node_modules of around 10000 files or more and 35 to 40MB

this is all you have to do.

If you need further node modules then just check https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install.html  this website for details.
